RE: Brian Banks


I have known Brian for 35 years. I have worked with him, directly, on two separate occasions.

Brian has three attributes that are invaluable to an early stage company: he has confidence, he has discipline and he has an infallible ability to see interactions from the other side of the table.

Brian’s confidence allows him to think clearly and realistically. This allows him to excel at prioritization. While many early stage company leaders can describe the future, which often stays 18 months away from today as the company fails to advance, Brian has the confidence to decide what to do in the next 18 days, and then the next 18 days, so that the 18 month vision does not stay a vision, but becomes a reality. His confidence is contagious and the traction his confidence creates is a super contagion. 

Discipline may not seem like much of a start-up superpower, but it is fundamental to operating effectively on limited resources. Because Brian knows that the greatest weakness in many early stage companies is the lack of completions, he does the hard work of effective ‘doing’: preparing, acting, completing, learning & resetting. It is a discipline that I have found is critical to success. His confidence may come from his discipline or his discipline may come from his confidence. I doubt you will care after Brian starts to work with your team.

Finally, Brian has a rare combination of empathy and integrity. His integrity surfaces in the simple expectation of himself to do the right thing the right way. This inherent integrity allows him to understand not just what he should do, but what others around him should be doing: seeing the right thing to do is, I assume, a reflex for him at this point.

However, Brian’s empathy allows him to take the time to understand who the players are in each relationship, what drivers exist for each of those people and how various approaches would be received by various players. The result is simple but powerful: not only is Brian often the only person in the meeting who knows what everyone in the meeting should be thinking about and focused on, he is almost always the only person who knows what everyone in the meeting is actually thinking about, and focused on. 

This ability to see interactions holistically, as they are and as they should be, allows Brian to consistently makes meaningful progress with customers or market partners, including eliminating mirage opportunities early and capturing real opportunities consistently.

If you have read this far, you are one easy decision away from growing.
